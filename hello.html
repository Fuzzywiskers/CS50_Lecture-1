<!--testing to see how to push other branches to github
    this is not part of the lecture, I'm just trying to learn
    I don't know why but I've actaully become interested in what I'm doing
    Why do I journal when I have this?
    hehe, who's going to find this I wonder?
-->

<!--ok, this is how you commit a branch
    -commit branch to main github
        git push --set origin [branch](remove the brakets)
-->

<!--some advice for mergin
    - whatever branches your merging, make sure nothing is pushed to main yet
      if something is pushed to main, the mergin branch will take over the one you're one
    - make sure to commit any changes you've made before changing to a different branch
      your changes may not be changed
    - only push after the merge has been successful
      otherwise there's no way to go back
    - if you want to go back to the way a file was, make sure to use the "git pull" on the file you're on
      can be very helpful
